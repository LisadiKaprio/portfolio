### What is it about?

This is a browser game, meant to be a Space Invaders clone with cute graphics centered around cats and sweets. Originally, the code was written in C# with the help of SFML library as part of the programming lectures in my university. Later on I implemented roughly the same code in Unity.

### What did I learn?

I was taught that the best way to learn any new framework, library, game engine or programming language is to first create some small projects with the help of lectures or Youtube tutorials. I needed to watch a Youtube tutorial to get this project transferred from C# and SFML to Unity, but it helped me gain the basic knowledge and lost of confidence that helped later when it came to bigger Unity projects.

The same happened when I was preparing for my internship that was focused on browser game development, which was an area I felt very unconfident in at that time. I asked what tools and frameworks were used for the developlment of the game - mostly Typescript and Vue.js, and then spent some weeks creating simple to-do lists and website clones just like in the Youtube tutorials. It paid off, and when the internship started, I could read the code and start implementing bug fixes and new features immediately afterwards.

Another important lesson was how quickly small-scale projects like this can be finished, and how rewarding it feels afterwards. Knowing this, I now often urge myself to finish projects in a limited amount of time, whenever it's reasonable, and to not be too perfectonistic for my own good, which would make me postpone the release date and thus postpone the feeling of gratification.
