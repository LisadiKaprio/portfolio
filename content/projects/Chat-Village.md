Chat Village is a series of widgets that allow chatters to live in the Twitch stream as small animal avatars. The game world itself is an imaginary village on the beach, and the interaction options are adapted to this setting (for example fishing and boat racing). Seastars serve as currency in this world to purchase clothing and initiate actions. You get seastars by fishing, winning events and by simply writing messages in chat.

This was the bachelor thesis project I have done during my Game Design studies at the HTW Berlin, DE:HIVE. I had to do all the full stack web development that was required for the project, as well as draw the assets. I also did a lot of playtesting on my own Twitch streams, and constantly came up with new features and quality of life improvements, as well as discovered bugs while streaming and letting my viewers interact with the game world.
