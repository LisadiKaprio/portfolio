### What is it about?

Chat Village is a series of widgets that give the chatters the ability to live in the Twitch stream as small animal avatars. They allow for many interactions, such as hugging, dancing, stealing, as well as earning in-game currency through fishing and boat-racing, to then spend it on avatar clothing.

### What did I learn?

Most of the learning experience for me here was about the importance of testing and directly communicating with the people that used this tool, both the twitch chatters and other streamers who have it set up in their channel. Features directly or indirectly requested by the chatters were very important in this project.

### What am I proud of?

This was my first experience writing a project with both frontend and backend from scratch, have them communicate successfully with each other as well as with Twitch, and have it run on a remote server 24/7 without any maintenance from my side. Even though it seemed to be an intimidating task at first, I am now feeling a bit more confident having accomplished that.
