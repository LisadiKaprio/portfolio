### What is it about?

In this game, player gets to place an island with its inhabitants anywhere in the real world, and then can talk to them. The player gets to communicate through a special system of unlockable icons.

### What was my contribution to the project?

I was responsible for a bigger part of the programming, which included the interface and the setting up of an AR project without a predefined template from Unity (which I believe are available officially now, but were only available from 3rd party sources back when the project was made, and were hard to find and understand). I have set up a system of writing dialogues, which would read them from directories and text files that another person on the team could create and edit easily, without having to specifically write code.

I also designed the interface visible in the game, making it my first experience in UI design.

### What did I learn?

The biggest learning experience was about working in a team of people on a small project in a limited amount of time. In this project I understood the importance of communicating with some project members one-on-one to get tasks done, as well as generally stay communicated with every project member to understand the state of project at any given moment and to understand who can be asked for help or might need some help themselves.
