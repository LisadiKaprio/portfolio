### What is it about?

This is a visual novel about taking care of a little fox-girl and helping her get familiar with the human world.

### What am I proud of in this project?

To facilitate the energetic and lively mood that the fox-girl brings forth, our team put special attention into making her character sprite move a lot on screen and show as much emotion as possible not only through visuals, but through subtle animation and soundeffects as well.

The interface also acts as a way to further involve the player into the atmosphere of the game. Best example of this is how the main menu shows the information stand of the park that the main character visits, and, when starting the game, the interface moves to reveal more of the park, until it finally shows the pond that the story starts at.

### What did I learn?

Most important lesson for me was the value of seeing a game through to completion and release. First I was unsure about the story and how I should visually present it, but pushing through without further overthinking was a smart move. It only took the planned two months for finalizing visuals and the interface, and I am happy with the end result and the fact that anyone can play it.

I got to see my game being played by many people, those I knew personally, as well as strangers. Seeing diverse reactions to different aspects of my game taught me to embrace criticism and appreciate it as a valid aspect of how players interact with the game.
