### What is it about?

Originally, this was a simple homework from my Game Design studies, meant to teach me the basics of 3D modelling. However, I liked the aesthetics of the finished level and I decided to add some gameplay to it and make it actually walkable, so people can directly interact with this project.

### What did I learn?

I learned the very basics of 3D modelling, mainly workflows for creating 3D assets that allow good performance in the game engine, as well as allow the level designer in the game engine to put together a diverse-looking level from a rather small set of modular assets and textures.

This project allowed me to learn from very embarrassing mistakes, for example creating railway assets with very detailed details on the rail joiners, which, when multiplied over the span of the whole railway, made the FPS of the game decrease drastically whenever the player would look at it.

Another embarrassing mistake was the way I created whole staircase with the rails as one single asset, which made it way too heavy and impossible to uniquely texture in Substance 3D Painter. Building the staircase inside of the game engine from a set of modular assets would have allowed for easier detailed texturing, as well as general customizability inside of the level.

I also learned the basic of creating a first-person 3D game experience, with features like pushing objects and placing items inside of the level, in this case graffities on walls.

This project also taught me the minimal requirements for a smooth user experience of a game project of any size, which I then forever remembered for my future game jam projects: ability to set sound/music volume and resolution, list of controls, as well as having the interface show at least minimal indication of how the game can be interacted with.


### What are some other things I had fun working on?

I really enjoyed taking flat cut outs of trees and grass, and making them move in the wind. I also enjoyed taking flat pictures that resembled buildings with windows and balconies, and arranging them in the level far away from the walkable area, so they look like actual buildings. I believe the flatness of all of these elements is still too noticeable, but the fact that most large-scale game projects basically arrange elements in the level like that is very fun to think about.
