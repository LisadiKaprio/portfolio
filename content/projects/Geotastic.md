### What is it about?

Geotastic is a Google Street View based browser game, known as a free alternative to another established browser game called Geoguessr. The basic concept is to guess where on the map you are based on a random Street View footage the player is given.Various game modes, single- and multiplayer, highscore records and community events are added on top of that, making it a sophisticated game project with large fanbase.

I initially got to know about this project through Twitch streams, in which the developer AnnoyingEdu himself was present either as a chatter, a guest or the streamer himself. I enjoyed getting to see the development process up close, and constantly contributed by providing bug reports and even creating artworks that got featured on the website as game assets.Naturally, when it was time to get my mandatory internship, spending this time contributing to Geotastic's code and design was my first choice.

### What tasks did I get to accomplish?

I have spent most of the internship improving user interface and fixing bugs. This was a smooth way to get used to working on a large established project and to learn to work confidently with Vue.js and Typescript.

My favourite part was finding cluttered UI and making it more clear and more spacious. In the redesigned login/register window I focused on making it more familiar and closer to how such modals are usually designed and modeled, because I noticed myself as a user of this website getting confused whenever I opened this window.

The multiplayer lobby settings display was also always confusing to me. And I wasn't the only one, as players often kept forgetting what settings were set up by the host, or didn't realize that the host has changed a certain setting. This happened because of the text clutter that was easy to gloss over, especially for casual players like myself. Because of this major flaw, redesigning this component was my top priority. Every setting got its dedicated descriptive icon on the panel, which can be hovered over to reveal details in a tooltip.

### Minor improvements of cluttered UI

favourite part was finding cluttered UI and making it more clear and spacious, making space to f.e. see the map, or just making the layout more spacious

### Gathering player feedback and fixing bugs

first directly through media like discord, or personal grudges that I thought would be good learning experience, since I had complete freedom with what I could work on and in what order. then implemented bug board

list of bugs fixed: complete transition of website to dark mode, improving hitboxes in dedicated geo software to improve experience for pro players, various visual bugs, 

### Learning experience based on an established large project
