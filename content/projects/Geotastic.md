various opportunities to improve UI and UX

### Improved match settings overview

did that based on a thing that annoyed me. also had other similar UI stuff improvements that I contributed to

favourite part was finding cluttered UI and making it more clear and spacious, making space to f.e. see the map, or just making the layout more spacious
