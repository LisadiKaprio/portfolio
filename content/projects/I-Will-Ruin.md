### What is it about?

This is a project that was done during a 3-day long game jam, dedicated to an AI-Vtuber on Twitch called Neuro-sama. It's a browser game with a straightforward gameplay based on pressing one button at specific moments. The main focus are the sound design and the cutesy visuals with some simple yet effective animations.

### What did I learn?

This project further taught me the specifics of participating in a game jam, or any other competition really. I learned that it's good - and fun - to engage with other projects on the game jam and give them suggestions for improvements. I also confirmed that it's best to create a game which can be played in browser right away to get more people to play it.

### What am I proud of the most?

I am proud of the small scope that I've set out to accomplish in the extremely limited amount of time, and the fact that I managed to implement everything that was necessary, without obsessing over "nice-to-have" features. The necessary things included the tutorial and the volume settings, which is rare to see in game jam projects with such a small development duration.

I am happy that I managed to create this many art assets in such a short span of time, even if they are a little bit rough around the edges - they still achieve the cutesy and friendly mood that I strived to create. The trick to having done them so fast was to limit my usage of the CTRL+Z command. :)

Another thing I'm happy about is that I implemented some character animations using code, specifically p5.js library features, instead of animating them frame by frame. A good example would be characters' arms whenever they're performing game actions, or the tools that keep flying out of Neuro-sama's toolbox.
