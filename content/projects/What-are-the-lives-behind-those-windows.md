In this game, you'll scroll through a tiny portion of a city filled with houses, and as you do, you'll notice that some of the windows in the buildings are lit up. These are your entry points into the lives of the people living in the city.
The game was created during the semester where I was busy with my internship. It's a project that was made over the span of multiple months and built bit by bit, with quite a bit of ideas and assets not used, and many workflow elements optimized to get the game done by a certain deadline: for example working with low resolution images, omitting details in artworks, keeping the artwork sketch-like and rough. The last point also applies to my attempt at making the grim message of the game show through.
The main goal was to communicate the end and the tragedies of people's lives, striking in the middle of a casual everyday life.
